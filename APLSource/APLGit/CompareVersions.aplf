⍝ Takes the name of an APL object and presents a GUI with all commits that object was changed by.
⍝ The user may then compare any two of them as many times as she likes.
⍝ Notes:\\
⍝ * If the name is not fully qualified (=does not start with a `#`) then it is assumed that it will
⍝   live in the namespace this function was called from.
⍝ * If the object does not exist any more in the project then the user will be prompted. We need
⍝   to know because only then can we compile a proper filename which is required by Git.\\
⍝ For what `x` can actually be see `EstablishProject`.\\
⍝ Returns `⍬`.\\
