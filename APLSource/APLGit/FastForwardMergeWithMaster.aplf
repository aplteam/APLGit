⍝ This function is usually executed in case work on a branch is finished and the branch can be deleted.
⍝ Like `MergeWithMaster`, `FastForwardMergeWithMaster` performs several steps:
⍝ 1. Pulls the master (if user agrees)
⍝ 2. Merge `currentBranch` with the master
⍝ 3. Push the master
⍝ 4. Delete the branch in question\\
⍝ Call `Squash` beforehand in order to clean up the commit history.\\
⍝ Pulls the master first (the user will be prompted) and pushes after the merge.\\
⍝ For what `y` can actually be see `EstablishProject`.\\
⍝ Performs a fast-forward merge, meaning that it will only work if the branch stems from the master.
⍝ If that's not the case (for example because you have fetched other people's work and therefore
⍝ changed your master branch) then use `MergeWithMaster` instead.
