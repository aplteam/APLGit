⍝ This function is usually executed only in case `FastForwardMergeWithMaster` failed.
⍝. See there why that might fail.\\
⍝ Like `FastForwardMergeWithMaster`, `MergeWithMaster` performs several steps:
⍝ 1. Pulls the master (if user agrees)
⍝ 2. Merge `currentBranch` with the master
⍝ 3. Push the master
⍝ 4. Delete the branch in question\\
⍝ Call `Squash` beforehand in order to clean up the commit history.\\
⍝ Pulls the master first (the user will be prompted) and pushes after the merge.\\
⍝ For what `y` can actually be see `EstablishProject`.\\
