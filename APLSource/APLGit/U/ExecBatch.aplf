⍝ This method executes a command and returns its standard output on `result`.\\
⍝ ** Don't** use this for programs that interact with a user! For example, don't use
⍝ this to fire up an APL session! This cannot work because standard output is redirected.\\
⍝ Use `WinExecute` for this which cannot capture standard output itself.\\
⍝ Performes the following actions:
⍝ * Puts `cmd` into a batch file which is a temp file.
⍝ * Execute that batch file with `WinExecute`.
⍝ * Circumvent the standard output of the batch file into another temp file.
⍝ * Waits until the temp file makes an appearance.
⍝ * Reads that temp file and returns the contents as `result`.
⍝ \\
⍝ * `success` is a Boolean with 1 indicating success.
⍝ * `rc` is a return code. 42 stands for "okay".
